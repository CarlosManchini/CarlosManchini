## OlÃ¡ ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Carlos, a statistician with both bachelor's and master's degrees, deeply passionate about uncovering hidden insights within data and the art of modeling the complexities of the real world. Embracing the realm of Data Science, I've uncovered the potential of predictive analysis and extracting value from data, all while applying my expertise in statistical modeling and programming to enable smart decision-making.

My most recent contribution in the job market as a statistical modeling analyst involved developing Collection/Behavior Score models and decision trees to monitor credit risk and enhance debt recovery. My research interests include deep learning models, NLP, data privacy, Bayesian statistical learning, and ensemble models. I have advanced programming knowledge in R, LaTeX and Shiny, as well as a good understanding of SQL, C, Python and Ox.

This Github page will host some of my works, projects and codes including my research.  I am enthusiastic about collaboration and engaging in discussions about fresh ideas and I hope this page will help others interested in machine learning and statistical modeling. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to share your thoughts â€“ I'm here to connect and learn together.
