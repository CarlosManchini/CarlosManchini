## OlÃ¡ ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Carlos, a statistician with both bachelor's (UFSM) and master's degrees (UFPE), deeply passionate about uncovering hidden insights within data and the art of modeling the complexities of the real world. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at ItaÃº Unibanco in the AIOps area, focusing on Generative AI to drive innovation and enhance operational efficiencies through data.

Previously, for over two years, I worked as a data scientist at Henry Schein, a global leader in healthcare products and services. There, I established the statistical modeling area for credit and collections, achieving significant improvements in debt recovery, cost savings, and process automation. I developed and implemented end-to-end machine learning models, using data-driven strategies to deliver measurable outcomes.

My research interests include deep learning models, NLP, Gen AI, data privacy, Bayesian statistical learning, and ensemble models. I have advanced programming skills in R, LaTeX, and Shiny, alongside proficiency in Python, SQL, C, and Ox. This GitHub page hosts some of my work, projects, and research, where I aim to share and collaborate on new ideas in machine learning and statistical modeling.

Feel free to connect if you'd like to discuss anything or explore collaboration opportunitiesâ€”I'm always eager to learn and grow together.
